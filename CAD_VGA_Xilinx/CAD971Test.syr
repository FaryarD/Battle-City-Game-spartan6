INFO:Xst:3218 - HDL ADVISOR - The RAM <Mram_time_m_01[3]_X_8_o_wide_mux_10526_OUT> will be implemented on LUTs either because you have described an asynchronous read or because of currently unsupported block RAM features. If you have described an asynchronous read, making it synchronous would allow you to take advantage of available block RAM resources, for optimized device usage and improved timings.

WARNING:Xst:3002 - This design contains one or more registers/latches that are directly
   incompatible with the Spartan6 architecture. The two primary causes of this is
   either a register or latch described with both an asynchronous set and
   asynchronous reset, or a register or latch described with an asynchronous
   set or reset which however has an initialization value of the opposite 
   polarity (i.e. asynchronous reset with an initialization value of 1).
    While this circuit can be built, it creates a sub-optimal implementation
   in terms of area, power and performance. For a more optimal implementation
   Xilinx highly recommends one of the following:

          1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches
             if not needed for required functionality
          2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
             and/or reset (both is preferred)
          3) Ensure all registers have the same initialization value as the
             described asynchronous set or reset polarity
          4) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
             set/reset to synchronous operation
             (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

  Please refer to http://www.xilinx.com search string "Spartan6 asynchronous set/reset" for more details.

(*) These 8 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,
and XST is not able to identify which are the primary clock signals.
Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
